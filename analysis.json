The tech support responded quickly and helped me bypass the tutorial which is the most finicky about taking the pictures.    Now that the app is up and running it's AWESOME!  True, sometimes the picture taking can be a bit problematic.  We have to find the right lighting and background in different parts of the house during different times of the day, but if I am patient with the set up, the kids become independent learners and are sooo excited every time the create a molecule.  So the star rating: Good tech support saved it from a 1, but the daily ritual of finding the best lighting prevents it from achieving 5 stardom.  The information, puzzles and application are soo worth the headache of setting it up.",

It has ended up being fun, educational, and simple enough for the kids to run.  Like others we had a hard time getting the app calibrated and the first molecule scanned.  For us the problem was with the first molecule the app kept labeling the atoms incorrectly.  Typically the app lets you manually change the labels if needed, but this is not an option with the first molecule.  I changed the lighting over the molecule to brighten the colors and then the app recognized them correctly and we were on our way.  One other tip, if the molecule seems impossible to connect correctly, just set the atoms next to each other without connecting them.  It works just fine.",
